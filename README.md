## Short description
### Problem Identification
In todays era uneven weather conditions had messed up the arrangements made by the local organisations and the national policies. These unpredictable weather conditions  not only harm the lives of people but also hampers a country's path to development. Predicting weather condition with the help of various criteria such as humidity,pressure & temprature can help more in todays world.
### How can technology help
These predicted weather conditions can help government and local authorities to take necessary actions to prevent casualities and harm.These techonologies can also help farmers to decide cropping pattern too.**A portal should be developed online to help farmers choose the crops according to the weather condition.This portal will provide them the best time for sowing and harvesting of the crops too.**
### The idea
Using historical data of weather to train a machine learning model, we can predict weather conditions for certain period of time more accurately in the future and at same time this data will be used for the bettter growth of the agriculture sector to plan various ameneties.
## The architecture
