## Short description
### Problem Identification
In todays era uneven weather conditions had messed up the arrangements made by the local organisations and the national policies. These unpredictable weather conditions  not only harm the lives of people but also hampers a country's path of development too. Predicting weather condition with the help of various criteria such as humidity,pressure & temprature can help more in todays world.
### How can technology help
These predicted weather conditions can help government and local authorities to take necessary actions to prevent casualities and harm. These techonologies can also help farmers to decide cropping pattern too.
### The idea
Using historical data to train a machine learning model, we can predict weather conditions for certain period of time more accurately in the future.
## The architecture
- Importing The Dataset.
- Using Data manipulation Techniques to arrange and clean the data.
- Using data visualisation techniques to understand the weather trends.
- Identifying the target variables in the dataset.
- Applying the machine learning model to train and test the data.
- Prediction of the weather conditions.
## Project roadmap
- Analyse current weather trends.
- Prediction of Weather with the help of the machine learning models.
